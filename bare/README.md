#Minimalist bare metal programming from scratch
##Background
Right now, the contents of this directory are based on the STM32F4-Discovery.
The development host will be based on Linux.
Minimalist means that I will use as few and simple tools as possible to write
code, store code to the board, and test the code (GNU suite, GNU Emacs, GNU
make, GDB, etc.).
